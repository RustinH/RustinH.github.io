### CPSC 120

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I really like playing blackjack with all my friends. It was fun to give a value to a card for a game I already liked. But it was a challenge to think about how the code would work without failing and giving me a ton of lint errors. It was a challenge then I had a breakthrough of  how to think and come up with a new way that would work to make it pass the test. I feel like I had to backtrack to fix a problem that worked before for what I was coding to make the code actually work so I can progress.

Lab 7, part 1 was a very interesting one. I know I have already talked about part 2 but part one really made me think. Why well we had to look at picture of signs to see what times we can and can't part in a ready to make the code realize if Car A is parked in Fullerton lot J at 9 pm it would say something along the lines of parking not allowed and it would recognize if you can or can't park in that area which to me would be very interesting and it has real world applications. I was able to learn how to look at the info and how to take the visual info into code that can be used

Lab 10, part 1 This lab was about counties but this was very different from how we would do this lab what was not like the other for me I had a monday lab and this lab was over break and this meant that we had to do this alone with no other person this was very different and it took a second to get use to but i was able to finish it and get it done i really liked this lab for the one reason and it was actually doing it solo i was able to challenge myself and my coding skill and it worked! This overall gave me a confidence boost and really made me happy for my future.
